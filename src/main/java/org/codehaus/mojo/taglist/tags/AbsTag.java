 *
 *  This class defines the required functions that each type of
 *  tag must implement.  The goal here is to allow different types
 *  of tags to be created by the user, but the call processing
 *  for each tag can be generic.
 *
 *  For example, a generic tag might search files for an exact string
 *  match of the tag, but a regex tag will use regular expressions in
 *  its searching.  Either way, the processing classes call each tag
 *  with the same function and get the same results.
