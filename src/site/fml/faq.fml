      <question>Where should a tag be placed to be considered in the report?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          A tag has to be preceded by either "*" or "//", ignoring whitespace,
          i.e. it has to be inside a single-line or multi-line JavaDoc comment.
          Otherwise it will be ignored in the report.

    <faq id="Why do I get an error stating the Taglist plugin must be executed after the JXR plugin?">
      <question>Why do I get an error stating the Taglist plugin must be executed after the JXR plugin?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The error message: "[ERROR] Taglist plugin MUST be executed after the JXR plugin.  No links to xref were generated." 
          is logged when the Taglist plugin is executed before the JXR (source cross-reference generator) plugin.  
          The Taglist plugin creates links in its report to the xref or test-xref files when tags are found; however, 
          if the JXR plugin has not been executed, the Taglist plugin cannot create the links.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some causes of this condition:<br/>
        <ul>
			<li><i>POM plugin order</i>:  the JXR plugin must be listed before the Taglist plugin in the POM or inherited 
			POM reporting section.</li>
			<li><i>Maven bug</i>:  in some versions of Maven, the report plugins execution order is erroneously 
			changed from the order defined in the POM file. 
			Please follow <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2258">the JIRA issue</a> for more information and updated status.</li>
        </ul>  
        </p>        
        <p>
          To resolve this error, check that the report plugins order is correct in the POM.  If you cannot modify the POM order, 
          or if doing so does not resolve the problem, a workaround is to execute the "site" goal twice.  The first time 
          you will receive the error and no links will be created, but the second pass will be successful because the xref files 
          already exist.
